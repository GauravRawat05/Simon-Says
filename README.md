# Simon-Says
This Simon Says game is a simple yet challenging memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game generates a sequence of colors that the player must remember and repeat. 
With each level, the sequence becomes longer, testing the player's memory and attention to detail. 
The game includes a "Game Over" feature that allows players to restart and try again, making it a fun and addictive experience.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, and contribute to the project. Happy playing!
